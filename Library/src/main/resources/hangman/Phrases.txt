break the ice
piece of cake
once upon a time
under the weather
back to square one
hit the nail on the head
let the cat out of the bag
the early bird catches the worm
time flies when youâ€™re having fun
a blessing in disguise
barking up the wrong tree
break a leg
all in good time
better late than never
practice makes perfect
speak of the devil
keep it under your hat
hit the books
throw in the towel
actions speak louder than words
