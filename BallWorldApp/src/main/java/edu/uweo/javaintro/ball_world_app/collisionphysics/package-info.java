/**
 * This package corresponds to the collisionphysics package 
 * from the BallWorld project,
 * originally written by Chua Hock-Chuan (ehchua@ntu.edu.sg).
 * Subpackages correspond to incremental development
 * per Chua's tutorial.
 * 
 * The names of the subpackages are synchronized
 * with the main code in edu.uweo.javaintro.ball_world_app.takeXX.
 * This package was introduced with edu.uweo.javaintro.ball_world_app.take02,
 * so the first subpackage is name ...take02;
 * there is no ...take01.
